const bio1 = `Indiana native with an early tech spark â€“ my journey kicked off with a garage sale gem, a Commodore 64, sparking a lifelong love for technology. 
   While at Indiana University, I earned a B.S. in Informatics, delving into the tech landscape. I began my professional career in tech support, working with 
   client-server applications and databases. Over time, I progressed to become a Software Engineer, specializing in .Net and React projects. To further my skills, 
   I completed over 600 hours of coursework at Eleven Fifty Academy. In my free time, I'm working on a full-stack application.  Eager to explore process automation and enhance my software engineering prowess,
    I strive to make meaningful impacts in every organization I'm part of.  Explore some of my projects below.`;
